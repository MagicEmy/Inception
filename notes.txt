Docker base image

Alpine Linux: 
It's often recommended for production deployments where minimizing image size 
is crucial, especially for microservices and cloud-native applications.

Debian: 
Strikes a good balance between size and functionality, making it a solid choice for 
a wide range of applications. It's often used when a more complete environment 
is needed compared to Alpine.

# Update package lists and upgrade existing packages
RUN apt update -y && apt upgrade -y: 
This line updates the package lists (apt update) and upgrades existing packages (apt upgrade). 
The -y flag is used to automatically confirm prompts during the update and upgrade process.

# Install NGINX and OpenSSL
RUN apt install -y \
    nginx \
    openssl
OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols. 
It provides a set of cryptographic functions and libraries that enable secure communication over a computer network.
OpenSSL is used for generating, managing, and verifying SSL/TLS certificates. 
SSL certificates are essential for establishing the authenticity of the server to clients and vice versa. 
They play a key role in the handshake process during the establishment of a secure connection. 
NGINX uses OpenSSL to handle SSL certificates and private keys.

RUN openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
    -out /etc/nginx/cert.pem \
    -keyout /etc/nginx/key.pem -subj "/C=/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}"

The RUN instruction you provided is used to generate a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate using OpenSSL. 
openssl req: Initiates a new certificate request.
-x509: Instructs OpenSSL to generate a self-signed certificate.The most common format for public key certificates is defined by X.509.
-newkey rsa:2048: Creates a new RSA private key of 2048 bits.
nodes: Specifies that the private key should not be encrypted with a passphrase. 
This is often done in the context of Docker containers to avoid manual passphrase entry.
-out /etc/nginx/cert.pem: Specifies the output file where the certificate will be saved. 
In this case, it's /etc/nginx/cert.pem.
-keyout /etc/nginx/key.pem: Specifies the output file where the private key will be saved. 
In this case, it's /etc/nginx/key.pem.
-subj "/C=/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}": Specifies the subject of the Public key certificate. 
The ${DOMAIN_NAME} variable is used to dynamically set the Common Name (CN) field of the certificate, typically representing the domain name. 
/C=: Country Name.
/ST=: State or Province Name
/L=: Locality Name
/O=: Organization Name.
/CN=${DOMAIN_NAME}: Common Name. This field represents the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for which the certificate is issued. 
${DOMAIN_NAME} variable is used here to dynamically set the Common Name. It's assumed that you have defined the DOMAIN_NAME variable elsewhere in your script or environment.
This command generates a self-signed certificate and private key, placing them in the specified locations (/etc/nginx/cert.pem and /etc/nginx/key.pem, respectively). 
The Common Name (CN) is set to the value of the ${DOMAIN_NAME} variable, which should be previously defined, typically in the Docker environment or a related configuration file.

This self-signed certificate is useful for development and testing purposes. 
In a production environment, it's recommended to obtain a valid SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) for proper security.


Additionally, after installing packages, it's a good practice to clean up the package manager's cache to reduce the image size:
# Clean up APT cache
RUN apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# copy files or directories from the host machine to the specified location within the Docker image. 
COPY conf/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
The file nginx.conf from the host machine will be copied to /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf in the Docker image.
This is a common practice when working with NGINX in Docker. 
The default.conf file is often used as the default configuration for NGINX, 
and by copying your custom configuration there, you can override the default NGINX configuration within the Docker image.

# Run nginx in the foreground so the container doesn't stop
CMD [ "nginx", "-g", "daemon off;" ]

-g: This option allows you to pass a configuration directive directly from the command line. 
In this case, it's used to provide NGINX with the configuration directive "daemon off;".

"daemon off;": This configuration directive tells NGINX not to run in the background as a daemon. 
By default, NGINX runs in the background as a daemon process. 
However, when running in a Docker container, it's common to run processes in the foreground, 
so that Docker can better manage them.

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

Instructs Docker to run the NGINX server, passing the configuration directive 
to keep it running in the foreground. 
This is beneficial in a containerized environment because Docker expects the 
main process of a container to remain running, and when the main process exits, 
the container is considered to have completed its execution.

this command ensures that NGINX runs in the foreground and remains the main process of the container,
allowing Docker to manage the container's lifecycle effectively.
